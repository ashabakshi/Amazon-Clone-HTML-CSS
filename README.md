# Amazon-Clone-HTML-CSS
A simple attempt at recreating Amazon’s homepage using HTML and CSS. Not a fully functional clone, but a design-focused project with responsive layouts and hover effects. No JavaScript or backend included—just pure HTML and CSS for practice. Clean code structure and basic styling to improve front-end skills.
